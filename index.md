# Favorite CPSC120L Labs
* Lab 1

  The first lab was one of my favorites as I was able to complete the assignment using prior knowledge. In addition to this the task itself was very simple and easy to understand, I believe it was one of the best possible labs that the class could start off with. I think this because of the tradition of printing “hello world” inside of a program. 

* Lab 6

  I think that the game of blackjack itself is interesting and so with lab 6 I thought it was a nice addition to add a program related to blackjack in part 2. In this lab I was able to learn about vectors as this was one of the first assignments to include the use of them. Overall I enjoyed trying out vectors belonging to writing code for something that I thought was interesting.

* Lab 9 

  The last lab I chose as one of my favorites was lab 9 as I like the environment I worked with during the assignment. I thought well of my partner’s and thought it was also interesting how we used the dictionary itself within our program. I believe this lab was important in figuring out how exactly you can use a text file within the same program.
